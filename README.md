# translinkAssessment

Please branch out from "**master**," as this (current) branch is "**main**". I tried to work on different (bit easier way) for everyone else to view but had some time issue. Couldn't resolve chromedriver placement for using both mvn or java command to run the test.

Steps to run the test:

** This script uses chrome & chromedriver version for 91. Please use chrome version 91 or download chromedriver accordingly to your chrome version, and replace chrome driver under resources folder **

1. Open the project in either Eclipse or IntelliJ (preferrably IntelliJ)
2. Go to /src/test/java/TransLinkAssessment.java
3. Right-click on the method under @Test
4. Click Run 'TestScenario()'
